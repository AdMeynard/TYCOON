This repository contains all the MATLAB files necessary to perform the algorithm TYCOON (Time-frequencY by Convex OptimizatioN). The theoretical background relative to the algorithm can be found in the following paper:  
**[1] M. Kowalski, A. Meynard and H-T. Wu, "Convex Optimization approach to signals with fast varying instantaneous frequency", *Applied and Computational Harmonic Analysis*, vol. 44, pp. 89-122, Jan. 2018, [available online](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01199615).**

Descriptions of the different folders:
- `AlgorithmTYCOON`: TYCOON functions.
- `OterMethods`: Other time-frequency analysis algorithms like Empirical Mode Decomposition and Synchrosquuezing.
- `PerfEvaluation`: functions to evaluate the quality of the time-frequency representation.
- `scriptsTYCOON`: scripts implmenting TYCOON on example signals.
- `SynthSig`: functions to synthesize the signal used in the paper to perform TYCOON.
